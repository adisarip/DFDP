\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we considered the freshness of data consumed by tasks within a periodic task system. We aimed to select the periods of input tasks in order to ensure the freshness of data consumed by the last task in the data flow chain. Without assumptions regarding the scheduler, we proved upper bounds on the periods of tasks in order to ensure the freshness of data through chains of tasks of length two and three for uniprocessor systems.
