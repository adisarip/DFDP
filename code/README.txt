Attempting to simulate and study the results of Data Freshness with Deferred Pre-emption

>>> Please feel free to modify this Readme text (checkout - modify - checkin), or add comments <<<

High level Goals for the activity:
==================================
1. Port the existing code for Data Freshness into FreeRTOS and make it more modular.
2. Modify the FPDS algorithm for task chains if needed (verify this requirement once) -- Not needed.
3. Integrate the FPDS algorithm with Data Freshness runs (DFDP) -- test runs of data sets
4. Study and compare the results with and without Deferred Pre-emption.
